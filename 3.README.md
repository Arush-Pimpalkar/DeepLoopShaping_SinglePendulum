# MPO ASD Comparison: Simple vs Frequency-Band Reward

## Overview
Attempting to replicate the MPO agent with frequency based rewards and comparing with a simple MPO with a time based reward. Integrated ground based noise from zenodo. 

## Reward Function Comparison

### Simple MPO
```python
reward = -|pitch_error| / 1000.0 - 0.01 * |control_effort|
```

### Frequency-Band MPO 
```python
# 1. Extract 3 frequency bands from pitch error signal
#    - Low: < 3 Hz
#    - Mid: 8-30 Hz (observation band)
#    - High: > 40 Hz

# 2. Compute power in each band (via FFT)

# 3. Apply sigmoid scoring (lower power = higher score):
#    - Low band target: 1e-6 µrad²/Hz
#    - Mid band target: 1e-8 µrad²/Hz
#    - High band target: 1e-10 µrad²/Hz

# 4. Combined reward = low_score × mid_score × high_score
```
